//*** documentation on credit script commands
//***************************************************************************************************
//***************************************************************************************************
//	The way the credits work is you pass commands to the script with what you want to display
//	These are the commands for text:
//		section	      - this is for passing text for a section header, such as 'CAST'
//		sub_section   - this is for smaller, sub-section style text, such as 'Filmed in XRAY VISION'
//		entry	      - this is for passing text for an entry with a header, such as 'Art Director', and a body, such as 'Tadd Whomever'
//		entry_single  - this is for a single line of entry header style text with no body
//		image	      - this is for displaying an image on-que at certain points in the credits
//		image_scroll  - this is to place an image to scroll up with the text
//		pause	      - this puts a pause in the scrolling text for spacing
//		done	      - ends the credits and disconnects back to the menu
//
//	These are the commands for pictures:
//		show	  - used to display a graphic on the screen
//		hide	  - used to take an already displayed graphic off the screen
//
//
//	Syntax for text commands:
//	All text commands are called with this statement and parameters:
//
//	waitthread global/credits.scr::credits_add <command> <header text> <body text>
//
//
//	Here's how you add text to scroll up the screen.  First, pick the command to use.
//	You have to specify the command in quotes.
//
//	"section"  - This is for displaying main headings, such as 'CAST'  You only need to enter
//		     the <header text> parameter for this command, <body text> is not used.
//
//	"sub_section"   - This is the same as section, but used for sub-section style headings such
//			  as 'Filmed in XRAY VISION'
//
//	"entry"    - This is for displaying people and their titles, such as 'Art Director'
//		     'Tadd Whomever'.  The <header text> is the label, which would be the
//		     'Art Director' portion.  The <body text> is the accompanying text, which
//		     would be the 'Tadd Whomever' portion.
//
//	"entry_single   - This is like entry text, only it's for a single line of <header text> with
//			  no <body text>.  So if you wanted to create just a list of persons after
//			  a section header, you would use this command
//
//	"image"	   - This is for passing an image command into the sequence of credits for more
//		     precise queing of when to display an image.  Following the "image" command
//		     you enter the following just like you would with a normal image command:
//
//		     <image_command> <element number> <image> [time] [ul_x] [ul_y] [br_x] [br_y]
//
//		     For a description of all the image parameters, look under the picture commands
//		     syntax descriptions below.
//
//	"image_scroll"  - This is for having a picture scoll in with the text in the credits.  You
//			- pass these parameters with it:
//
//			  <image> [ul_x] [br_x] [br_y]
//
//			  <image> first is the reference to the picture.  <ul_x> is the x coordinate
//			  where you want it to scroll up the screen.  <br_x> <br_y> specifiy the
//			  bottom right corner of the image (works as the normal image command).
//			  NOTE: DO NOT use images that are taller than 80 units.  If an image is
//			  taller than 80 units, then you will see it disappear since it won't be
//			  completely obscured by the top border.
//
//	"pause"    - This is for placing blank spacing between entries.  So say you entered all
//		     of the 'CAST' entries, and you want some space before you start the next
//		     section of text.  Pause is used to place that space.
//
//	"done"     - This is when the credits are done and you want to return back to the main
//		     menu.  This will fade out the borders, wait a second, then go back to
//		     the main menu.  Make sure to fade out everything else and wait a bit for
//		     whatever remaining text to scroll off the screen, else it will bail out
//		     in the middle of it scrolling.
//
//
//	Syntax for Picture commands:
//	All picture commands are called with this statement and parameters:
//
//	waitthread global/credits.scr::credits_image <command> <element number> <image> [time] [ul_x] [ul_y] [br_x] [br_y]
//
//
//	Here's how you display a picture up on the screen.  All pictures will display behind the
//	borders of the screen, so you want to make sure all your pictures are made to be in that area.
//	The important thing to remember when adding pictures is the <element number> that you use.
//	You have 100 element numbers you can use, 1 - 100 (the script will error out if you go
//	outside of this range, or don't enter one at all).  The number determines which pictures get
//	drawn on top of other pictures.  The higher the number, the more 'on-top' that picture is.
//	So element 100 is the topmost picture and will draw on top of all other elements, and 1 is the
//	bottommost element and will draw under all other elements.  Also, you can use the same element
//	number for multiple pictures, but if you assign a new picture to a used element, that element
//	will switch to that picture, whether it's shown or not.  So keep track of your <element number>
//	that you use.  One thing to note is to wait the appropriate amount of time before sending the
//	next picture.  Else you'll see the transition occur before the pictures fully fade.
//
//	Here is the explaination of all the parameters and which ones are optional:
//
//	<command> 	- Commands given have to be in quotes as with text commands.  There are only
//			  two draw commands.  You have to enter this parameter.
//
//			  "show" - This will fade the desired picture in on the specified <element number>
//			  "hide" - This will fade the desired <element number> out
//
//	<element number>   This is the element number to display a picture on, numbers 1 - 100.
//			   You have to enter this parameter.  NO quotes used for this parameter.
//
//	<image>		-  This is the graphic to display, entered in quotes.  It can either be a shader name, or a 
//			   direct reference to the picture.  If it's a direct reference to a picture,
//			   then you have to enter the path starting with "textures/" (with the rest of the path).
//			   So for example, this is a reference to a direct picture:
//
//			   "textures/mohmenu/credits/bottomborder"
//
//			   It is recommended to place all images for the credits screen in the
//			   "textures/mohmenu/credits/" folder where the borders already are.
//			   You have to enter this paramter.
//
//	[time]		-  This is an optional parameter that's not entered within quotes.  If a time
//			   is entered, then the displayed picture will automatically fade out in the
//			   specified time.  So if you enter a time of 5, then after 5 seconds the
//			   picture will fade without having to give a fade command.  Without the time
//			   parameter, an image will stay on the screen until it is told to fade.
//
// [ul_x] [ul_y] [br_x] [br_y]  -  These last four parameters are used to specify a direct placement
//				   and size of a picture.  The first two parameters specify the
//				   upper-left coordinate for the image (hence the ul).  The last two
//				   parameters specify the bottom-right corner for the image (hence the br).
//				   All coordinates are based on a 640 x 480 setting, no matter what the
//				   user's resolution.  To use these parameters, ALL 4 have to be used.
//				   If you enter only one, and not the rest, bad things can happen and
//				   borkiness behavior will occur.
//
//				   NOTE:  If you want to use these parameters but do NOT wish to use
//				          the [time] parameter, just enter a value of NIL where the [time]
//					  parameter is.
//
//
//
//	I left in my test entries just as an example for you to look at.  MAKE SURE TO REMOVE ALL
//	THE SAMPLE ENTRIES WHEN YOU ENTER THE FINAL CREDITS!!!!  One techinque you might want to use
//	is to display the pictures using a seperate thread, so you can control and keep track of the
//	timing easier, rather than intermixing all the pictures with the text since reading over that
//	might get confusing.  Come see me if you'd like some help with this.
